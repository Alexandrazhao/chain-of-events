# Sketch 10: Chain of Events

**Imagine and illustrate an imaginary chain of events.**

## Rules

Your sketch will include two components:

1. **A simple written "story" (no more than 500 words) about a
sequence of things that cause other things to happen.** Write in the
present tense. Your story will take the form of a written description
of discrete events in which an action precipitates another action,
which precipitates another action, and so on. The actions can be
physical (e.g. "An anvil falls through a roof.") or non-physical
(e.g. "A country declares war on another country."). The beginning and
end state of your sequence should be clearly articulated.

   *Save your story as a web page published to GitHub.*

2. **An illustration of how your events might be "set into motion" in
a 2D game space with gravity and other physical forces that can be
simulated by the Unity 2D game engine.** Gravity will most likely set
off an initial action, and all resulting events should automatically
occur without manipulation by outside agents (i.e. a "player"). The
hand-illustrated mockup of your story should visualize a static-screen
2D game space.

   Note: If the events in your story are immaterial or abstract (e.g. a
person tells someone something, which precipitates a mental decision),
you must consider how to represent these immaterial events with visual
symbols or metaphors. Use arrows, text boxes, symbols, etc. to
describe what will happen when your sketch becomes animated.

   *Scan/photograph this hand-drawn image and save it as a .JPG or .PNG
file and add this image to your web page.*

## Learning Objectives
1. Consider embedded narrative components for a game-like environment.
2. Devise approaches for translating abstract ideas and actions in
visual space.
3. Plan and prepare a game idea (preproduction).
4. Brush up on HTML.

## Tips

1. The first part of the assignment is not bound by physical
limitation. Write a good story. Don't worry about whether or not it
would be easy to make your sequence of events into a game.

2. If you're unsure about what to write about, consider basing your
story on a pre-existing story, a life experience, historical events, a
physical process in nature, a recipe, Ikea instructions, or any other
pre-existing description of sequenced actions in which one thing leads
to another.

3.  Before you start the second part of the assignment, you will need
to understand the kinds of physical forces/events/actions Unity's 2D
physics engine can handle without scripting. It's a good idea to
complete this week's Unity 2D physics tutorials (link on class web
page) before creating your visual illustration.
